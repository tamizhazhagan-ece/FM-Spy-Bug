# FM Spy Bug

A mini project by **Tamizhazhagan S** and **Shabhareswaharan G**

## 🔍 Project Description

The FM Spy Bug is a compact wireless microphone transmitter that operates on wideband frequency modulation (WBFM). It is designed for covert audio surveillance, making it possible to monitor conversations secretly via FM radio waves.

## 🛠️ Components

- Resistors: 22kΩ, 47kΩ, 330Ω
- Capacitors: 1nF (×3), 4.7pF, 22nF
- Variable Capacitor: 50pF
- Inductor: 8 turns, 6mm diameter air core (25 SWG)
- Transistor: 2N3904 or BF494 (NPN)
- Microphone
- Antenna: 20cm copper wire (24 gauge)

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The project uses a Colpitts oscillator for generating the carrier signal. Audio from the microphone modulates the carrier frequency using frequency modulation (FM), which can then be received using a standard FM radio.

## 📊 Output

- Circuit diagram
- Output waveform
